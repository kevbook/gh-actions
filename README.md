2. [Act](https://github.com/nektos/act) to test Github Actions locally
   - Docker issue: https://github.com/nektos/act/issues/2239#issuecomment-1979819940

```shell
# Test the action locally using act
$ act --secret GITHUB_TOKEN \
    --workflows=./tests/create-promotion-pr.yml push

```

```yaml
# .github/workflows/promotion-pr.yml

  # On push to main branch (including PR closed)
  push:
    branches: [main]
